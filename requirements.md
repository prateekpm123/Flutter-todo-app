Flutter Developer Technical Assessment (24-Hour
Challenge)
Objective:
Build a production-ready Flutter application focusing on UI/UX design implementation, clean
architecture, API integration, state management, and performance optimization. This task evaluates
real-world mobile development capability.
Task: Build a Task Management / Productivity App
• User Login & Registration UI (mock API allowed or real backend)
• Home screen displaying list of tasks fetched from API
• Create, Edit, Delete tasks (API integrated)
• Task fields: Title, Description, Status, Due Date
• Pull-to-refresh functionality
• Proper loading, empty, and error states
Design Expectations (Very Important):
• Clean and modern UI (Material 3 or custom theme)
• Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
• Reusable widgets/components
• Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
• Proper navigation flow (named routes or router-based)
Technical Expectations:
• Use proper state management (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, or similar)
• API integration using http or dio
• Error handling and retry logic
• Token storage using secure storage (flutter_secure_storage)
• Basic input validation
• Clean folder structure (models, services, providers, screens, widgets)
Bonus (Optional but Recommended):
• Pagination or infinite scroll
• Dark mode support
• Local caching (Hive or SharedPreferences)
• Basic animations or micro-interactions
• Unit tests for one module
Deployment / Submission Requirements:
• Provide GitHub repository link
• Provide APK build file OR TestFlight/Play Store test link
• Include README with setup instructions
• Explain architecture and state management choice
• Include sample API documentation if using custom backend
AI Usage Policy:
• You are allowed to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, AI Agents, etc.)
• However, you must understand and explain your implementation clearly in follow-up discussion
• Projects that are clearly copied or not understood will be rejected
Evaluation Criteria:
• UI/UX Implementation & Design Quality – 25%
• API Integration & State Management – 20%
• Code Structure & Architecture – 15%
• Error Handling & Edge Case Management – 10%
• Performance & Responsiveness – 10%
• Deployment & Documentation – 10%
• Understanding During Discussion – 10%
